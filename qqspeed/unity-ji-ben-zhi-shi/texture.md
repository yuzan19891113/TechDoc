# Texture

HDR Encode:**RGBM** encoding packs \[0;8\] range into \[0;1\] with multiplier stored in the alpha channel. Final value is RGB_A_8.



### ASTC texture compression

ASTC texture compression is an official extension to the OpenGL and OpenGL ES graphics APIs. ASTC can reduce the memory required by your application and reduce the memory bandwidth required by the GPU.

ASTC offers texture compression with high quality, low bitrate and has many control options. It includes the following features:

* Bit rates range from 8 bits per pixel \(bpp\) to less than 1bpp. This enables you to fine-tune the trade-off of space against quality.
* Support for 1 to 4 color channels.
* Support for both low dynamic range \(LDR\) and high dynamic range \(HDR\) images.
* Support for 2D and 3D images.
* Support for selecting different combinations of features.
